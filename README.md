## üîí Authentication

- Firebase Google Auth is used for authentication.
- Protected routes (like `/profile` and `/post`) require login.
- Auth state is managed with Zustand and checked on app load.

---

## üì¶ API Integration

- All API requests are made via Axios.
- The backend should expose endpoints for authentication, user info, and ideas (see `/store` and `/utils/axiosInstance.js`).

---

## üé® Customization

- Fonts: [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) (headings), [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) (paragraphs), [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) (buttons)
- Easily customizable via Tailwind config and component props.
